# v0.0.5 - 2 known and one unnoticed bugs fixed

The smart bombs still don't behave as the arcade, still trying to figure it
out...

- Changed red and blue to make it slightly more readable
- Fixed collision bug (hopefully)
- Fixed hanging sound bug
- Structural fixes and cleanups, cosmetical changes


# v0.0.4 - Feature complete, 3 known bugs

First feature complete version, ready to be playtested.

It has 3 known bugs:

Dodge algorithm of smartbombs is too good and nothing like the arcade
When breaking out of the game with escape, sometimes a sound might hang
There's a collision bug between explosions and flyers
If you download and play it anyways, happy to hear of bugs not listed here.
