# Missile Command in pygame and tinyecs

This is just a testbed to figure out how to work with tinyecs.

This project does too much ECS, but I mostly learned that by doing it this
way.

## Installation

### Linux bash instructions

```console
git clone https://github.com/dickerdackel/missilecommand
cd missilecommand
python3 -m venv --prompt missilecommand .venv
source .venv/bin/activate.sh
pip install .
```

After that, just run `missile` in the activated env.

### Windows

No idea, depends on your environment.  Probably something similar to the
above.
