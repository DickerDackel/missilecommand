# v0.0.4 - Feature complete, 3 known bugs

First feature complete version, ready to be playtested.

It has 3 known bugs:

Dodge algorithm of smartbombs is too good and nothing like the arcade
When breaking out of the game with escape, sometimes a sound might hang
There's a collision bug between explosions and flyers
If you download and play it anyways, happy to hear of bugs not listed here.
